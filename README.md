# Credit-Risk-Modeling

- Engineered comprehensive credit risk models (PD, LGD, and EAD) using Python to estimate expected loss, enabling precise risk assessment and capital allocation for loan portfolios
- Applied advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, linear regression, and classification techniques for credit scoring and loss forecasting
- Enhanced model stability and data integrity by implementing automated preprocessing pipelines to handle missing values and dummy variables, creating standardized input structure for downstream analysis
- Validated model accuracy using AUC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistics, ensuring the models successfully distinguished between defaulting and non-defaulting loans with high confidence
