# Credit-Risk-Modeling

- Developped comprehensive cresit risk models, including Propability of Default(PD), Loss Given Default(LGD), and Exposure at Default(EAD) using Python, to calculate the expected loss for loan porfolios
- Applied advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, linear regression, and and classification techniques to build and validate predictive models
- Implemented data preprocessing techniques, such as handle missing values, process dummy variables, and calculating recovery dates, to ensure high-quality input data
- Conducted model performance evaluation using Area Under the Curvez(AUC) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov(KS) statistics to ensure robust and reliable predictions
